    2017-10-29 - bdubbs
    For version 7.56.1 I had a lot of test failures which included long
    timeouts.  Could not determine the cause of the timeouts or failures,
    but I was missing c-ares, MIT Kerberos, ldap, samba, and the six
    external packages.

    2017-12-01 - bdubbs
    Still a lot of test failures.  I did have c-ares, Kerberos, and ldap
    installed this time.  Best guess is that servers are not available.

    2018-08-01 - renodr
    No test failures, but I didn't have any of the optional dependencies except
    for c-ares and libidn2. I might re-run this test suite before release with
    all of the optional deps, but right now, it isn't a priority - rather
    the security fix is.

         and no. I don't have smb - so commenting the rest of this:
      To run the test suite, issue: <command>make test</command>. Many tests
      may fail that depend on optional dependencies that may not be installed
      or upstream servers that may not be available, especially for tests
      numbered 700 and above.
      Test time may be significantly increase due to hanging tests that fail.

I only have c-ares and libidn2 installed, I will likely try before release
with all optional dependencies in the book installed.

=========
7.61.1 NOTE: The test suite is extremely noisy, complaining about verification errors.
It's possible this is due to openssl-1.1.1, BUT 79/79 tests report as 100% OK. I had
c-ares, libpsl, and libidn1/2 installed. - Doug
