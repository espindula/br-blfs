  <title>Video Utilities</title>

  <para>
    This chapter always seems to be the favorite chapter. It's probably because
there is a lot of satisfaction in playing your first video when you have
spent so much time getting to that point. All those libraries, all the
configurations and your reward is that you finally get to watch a movie. Not
to worry though, there is always one more CODEC to install.
