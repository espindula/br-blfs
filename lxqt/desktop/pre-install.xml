    <title>Notes about building LXQt dependencies</title>

    <para>
      To build LXQt, the following steps are recommended:
    </para>

    <procedure>
      <step>
        <para>
          First, build the whole <xref linkend="xorg"/>, including Wayland support
with required and recommended dependencies.  Test that the environment works
with twm as the window manager.  With experience, some of the packages can
be omitted, but that is not recommended for first time users.
        </para>
      </step>

      <step>
        <para>
          Second, build the required parts of Qt. The full package, <xref
linkend="qt5"/> is quite long and has a lot of dependencies.  As an
alternative, the required components needed for LXQt can be built using the
procedures in <xref linkend="qt5-alternate"/>.
        </para>
      </step>

      <step>
        <para>
          Finally build the LXQt desktop using the pages below in order.  The packages
in the applications section are optional, but as a minimum, <xref
linkend="qterminal"/> is recommended.
        </para>
      </step>
    </procedure>
