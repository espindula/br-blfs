  <title>Display Managers</title>

  <para>
    Display Managers are graphical programs used for starting the graphical
display (currently, the X server) and providing a login capability for a
Window Manager or Desktop Environment.
  </para>

  <para>
    There are many Display Managers available. Some of the more well known
include: <application>GDM</application>, <application>KDM</application>
(deprecated), <application>LightDM</application>,
<application>LXDM</application>, <application>Slim</application>, and
<application>SDDM</application>.
  </para>

  <para>
    Among the Desktop Environments available for Linux you find:
<application>Enlightenment</application>, <application>GNOME</application>,
<application>KDE</application>, <application>LXDE</application>,
<application>LXQt</application>, and <application>XFce</application>.
  </para>

  <para>
    Choosing a Display Manager or Desktop Environment is highly subjective.  The
choice depends on the look and feel of the packages, the resources (memory
and disk space) required, and the utilities included.
  </para>

  <para>
    In this chapter, the installation instructions of some Display Managers are
presented. Later in the book, you will find other ones, which are provided
as part of some Desktop Environments.
