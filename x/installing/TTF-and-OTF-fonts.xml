    <title>About TTF and OTF fonts</title>

    <para>
      Originally, Xorg provided only bitmap fonts. Later, some scalable Type1
fonts were added, but the desktop world moved on to using TrueType and Open
Type fonts. To support these, Xorg uses Xft, the X FreeType interface
library.
    </para>

    <para>
      These fonts can provide hints, which <application>fontconfig</application>
uses to adjust them for maximum readability on computer monitors. On linux
you should always prefer the hinted versions, if available (in general the
latin, cyrillic and greek alphabets can use hints, most other writing
systems do not use hinting).
    </para>

    <para>
      A few fonts are provided as collections (TTC or OTC) where font data is
shared between different fonts, thus saving disk space. Treat these in
exactly the same way as individual TTF or OTF files.
    </para>

    <para>
      If a font provides both TTF and OTF forms, prefer the OTF form in linux, it
may provide more features for programs which know how to use them (such as
xelatex).
    </para>

    <para>
      For some scripts <application>pango</application> is required to render
things correctly, either by selecting different glyph forms, or by combining
glyphs - in both cases, according to the context. This applies particularly
to arabic and indic scripts.
    </para>

    <para>
      Standard scalable fonts that come with <application>X</application> provide
very poor Unicode coverage.  You may notice in applications that use
<application>Xft</application> that some characters appear as a box with
four binary digits inside.  In this case, a font with the required glyphs
has not been found.  Other times, applications that don't use other font
families by default and don't accept substitutions from
<application>Fontconfig</application> will display blank lines when the
default font doesn't cover the orthography of the user's language.
    </para>

    <para>
      The fonts available to a program are those which were present when it was
started, so if you add an extra font and wish to use it in a program which
is currently running, then you will have to close and restart that program.
    </para>

    <para>
      Some people are happy to have dozens, or even hundreds, of font files
available, but if you ever wish to select a specific font in a desktop
application (for example in a word processor) then scrolling through a lot
of fonts to find the right one is slow and awkward - fewer is better. So,
for some font packages you might decide to install only one of the fonts -
but nevertheless install the different variants (italic, bold, etc) as these
are all variations for the same font name.
    </para>

    <para>
      In the past, everybody recommended running <command>fc-cache</command> as
the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user after installing or
removing fonts, but this is no-longer necessary on linux,
<application>fontconfig</application> will do it automatically if needed and
if its caches are more than 30 seconds old. But if you add a font and want
to immediately use it then you can run that command (as a normal user).
    </para>

    <para>
      There are several references below to CJK characters. This stands for
Chinese, Japanese and Korean, although modern Korean is now almost all
written using the phonetic Hangul glyphs (it used to sometimes use Hanja
glyphs which are similar to Chinese and Japanese). Unicode decided to go for
<ulink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification">Han
Unification</ulink> and to map some Chinese and Japanese glyphs to the same
codepoints. This was very unpopular in Japan, and the result is that
different fonts will render some codepoints in quite different shapes. In
addition, Simplified Chinese will sometimes use the same codepoint as
Traditional Chinese but will show it differently, somewhat analogous to the
different shapes used for the letters 'a' and 'g' in English (single-storey
and two-storey), except that in a language context one will look "wrong"
rather than just "different".
    </para>

    <para>
      Unlike most other packages in this book, the BLFS editors do not monitor the
versions of the fonts on this page - once a font is good enough for general
use, the typical additions in a new version are minor (e.g. new currency
symbols, or glyphs not for a modern language, such as emojis or playing
cards). Therefore, none of these fonts show version or md5 information.
    </para>

    <para>
      The list below will not provide complete Unicode coverage.  Unicode is
updated every year, and most additions are now for historic writing
systems. For almost-complete coverage you can install <xref
linkend="noto-fonts"/> (about 180 fonts when last checked) but that number
of fonts makes it <emphasis>much</emphasis> less convenient to select a
specific font in a document, and most people will regard many of them as a
waste of space. We used to recommend the <ulink
url="https://unifont.org/fontguide/">Unicode Font Guide</ulink>, but that
has not been updated since 2008 and many of its links are dead.
    </para>

    <para>
      Rendered examples of most of these fonts, and many others, with details of
what languages they cover, some examples of latin fonts with the same
metrics (listed as "Substitute latin fonts") and various files of dummy text
to compare fonts of similar types, can be found at this <ulink
url="http://zarniwhoop.uk/ttf-otf-notes.html#examples"> font
comparison</ulink> page. That site also covers other current writing
systems.
    </para>

    <para>
      Fonts are often supplied in zip files, requiring <xref linkend="unzip"/> to
list and extract them, but even if the current release is a tarball you
should still check to see if it will create a directory (scattering the
contents of a zipfile or tarball across the current directory can be very
messy, and a few fonts create odd __MACOSX/ directories. In addition, many
fonts are supplied with permissions which do not let 'other' read them - if
a font is to be installed for system-wide use, any directories must be mode
755 and all the files mode 644, so change them if necessary.  If you forget,
the root user may be able to see a particular font in
<command>fc-list</command> but a normal user will not.
    </para>

    <para>
      As a font installation example, consider the installation of the <xref
linkend="dejavu-fonts"/>. In this particular package, the TTF files are in a
subdirectory. From the unpacked source directory, run the following commands
as the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user:
    </para>

<screen role="root"><userinput>install -v -d -m755 /usr/share/fonts/dejavu &amp;&amp;
install -v -m644 ttf/*.ttf /usr/share/fonts/dejavu &amp;&amp;
fc-cache -v /usr/share/fonts/dejavu</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      If you wish, you can also install any licenses or other documentation,
either alongside the font or in a corresponding directory under <filename
class="directory">/usr/share/doc/</filename>.
    </para>

    <para>
      A few fonts ship with source as well as with the completed TTF or OTF
file(s). Unless you intend to modify the font, and have the correct tools
(sometimes <xref linkend="fontforge"/>, but often commercial tools), the
source will provide no benefit, so do not install it. One or two fonts even
ship with Web Open Font Format (WOFF) files - useful if you run a webserver
and want to use that font on it, but not useful for desktops.
    </para>

    <para>
      To provide greater Unicode coverage, you are recommended to install some of
the following fonts, depending on what websites and languages you wish to
read.  The next part of this page details some fonts which cover at least
latin alphabets, the final part deals with come CJK issues.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        You are strongly recommended to install the <xref linkend="dejavu-fonts"/>.

the Bitstream Vera fonts and provide Latin-based scripts with accents and
punctuation such as "smart-quotes" and variant spacing characters, as well
as Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Armenian, Georgian and some other

    xreflabel="freefont">GNU FreeFont</bridgehead>

    <para>
      <ulink url="https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gnu/freefont/">GNU FreeFont</ulink>
&ndash; This set of fonts covers many non-CJK characters, in particular some
of the variants of latin and cyrillic letters used in minority languages,
but the glyphs are comparatively small (unlike DejaVu fonts which are
comparatively large) and rather light weight ("less black" when black on
white is used) which means that in some contexts such as terminals they are
not visually pleasing, for example when most other glyphs are provided by
another font.  On the other hand, some fonts used primarily for printed
output, and many CJK fonts, are also light weight.
    </para>

    </indexterm>

    <para>
      The <ulink url="https://github.com/liberationfonts/"> Liberation
fonts</ulink> provide libre substitutes for Arial, Courier New, and Times
New Roman. <application>Fontconfig</application> will use them as
substitutes for those fonts, and also for the similar Helvetica, Courier,
Times Roman although for these latter it can prefer a different font (see
the examples in the 'Substitutes' PDFs at <ulink
url="http://zarniwhoop.uk/files/PDF-substitutes/"> zarniwhoop.uk).</ulink>
    </para>

    <para>
      Many people will find the Liberation fonts useful for pages where one of

    </para>

    <bridgehead renderas="sect3" id="corefonts"
    xreflabel="corefonts">Microsoft Core Fonts</bridgehead>

    <para>
      The <ulink url="https://corefonts.sourceforge.net/">Microsoft Core
fonts</ulink> date from 2002. They were supplied with old versions of
Microsoft Windows and were apparently made available for general use.  You
can extract them from the 'exe' files using
<application>bsd-tar</application> from <xref linkend="libarchive"/>.  Be
sure to read the license before using them. At one time some of these fonts
(particularly Arial, Times New Roman, and to a lesser extent Courier New)
were widely specified on web pages. The full set contains Andale Mono,
Arial, Arial Black, Comic Sans MS, Courier New, Georgia, Impact, Times New
Roman, Trebuchet MS, Verdana and Webdings.
    </para>

    <para>
      Please note that if you only want to use a font with the same metrics
(character size, etc) as Arial, Courier New, or Times New Roman you can use
the libre Liberation Fonts (above), and similarly you can replace Georgia
with Gelasio.
    </para>

    <para>
      Although many old posts recommend installing these fonts for better-looking
output, there are more recent posts that these are ugly or 'broken'. One
suggestion is that they do not support anti-aliasing.
    </para>

    <para>
      The newer fonts which Microsoft made their defaults in later releases of MS
Windows or MS Office (Calibri and Cambria) have never been freely
available. But if you do not have them installed you can find metric
equivalents (Carlito, Caladea) above.

    <para>
      The <ulink url="https://www.google.com/get/noto/">Noto fonts</ulink> ('No
Tofu', i.e.  avoiding boxes with dots [hex digits] when a glyph cannot be
found) is a set of fonts which aim to cover <emphasis>every glyph in
unicode, no matter how obscure</emphasis>. These fonts, or at least the Sans
Serif fonts, are used by KF5 (initially only for gtk applications). If you
want to cover historic languages, you can download all the fonts by clicking
on the link at the top of that page.
    </para>

    <para>
      People using languages written in Latin, Greek or Cyrillic alphabets need
only install Noto Sans itself, and perhaps Noto Sans Symbols for currency
symbols. For more details on the CJK fonts see <xref linkend="NotoSansCJK"/>
below. There are also separate fonts for every other current writing system,
but these too will also require Noto Sans (or Noto Serif) and perhaps Noto
Symbols.
    </para>

    <para>
      However, you should be aware that <application>fontconfig</application>
knows nothing about Noto fonts. The 'Noto Sans Something' fonts are each
treated as separate fonts (and for Arabic there is not a specifically Sans
name), so if you have other fonts installed then the choice of which font to
use for missing glyphs where 'Noto Sans' is specified will be random, except
that Sans fonts will be preferred over <emphasis>known</emphasis> Serif and
Monospace fonts because Sans is the fallback for unknown fonts.

      When KDE Frameworks 5 was first released, it used the <ulink url=
"https://download.kde.org/stable/plasma/5.4.3/oxygen-fonts-5.4.3.tar.xz">
Oxygen fonts</ulink> which were designed for integrated use with the KDE
desktop. Those fonts are no-longer actively maintained, so KDE made a
decision to switch to <xref linkend="noto-fonts"/>, but for the moment they
are still <emphasis>required</emphasis> by 'startkde'.
    </para>

    <para>
      Originally these fonts were only supplied as source, needing <xref
linkend="cmake"/> and <xref linkend="fontforge"/> to create the TTF
files. But for a while the source has also included the prepared TTF.  The
only unusual feature is that each TTF file is in its own subdirectory
(<filename class="directory">oxygen-fonts/{*-?00}/</filename>) with the
source in further subdirectories. You could just install the whole tarball
if you prefer, although that will waste space.

      This set of fonts from Adobe (seven different weights) includes what is now

source-code-pro</ulink> contains OTF (preferred) and TTF as well as the

    </para>

    <para>
      To use this in terminals, you probably only want the Regular font.
    </para>

      There is also an older TTF version of this available from <ulink url=

    <bridgehead renderas="sect3" id="CJKfonts"
    xreflabel="CJKfonts">CJK fonts:</bridgehead>

    <para>
      As indicated earlier, usage of a combination of Chinese, Japanese and Korean
can be tricky - each font only covers a subset of the available codepoints,
the preferred shapes of the glyphs can differ between the languages, and
many of the CJK fonts do not actually support modern Korean.
    </para>

    <para>
      Also, by default <application>fontconfig</application> prefers Chinese to
Japanese. Tuning that is covered at <xref
linkend="prefer-chosen-CJK-fonts"/>.
    </para>

    <para>
      Although Unicode has been extended to allow a very large number of CJK
codepoints, those outside the Base Plane (greater than U+0xFFFF) are not
commonly used in Mandarin (the normal form of written Chinese, whether
Simplified (PRC) or Traditional (Taiwan)), or Japanese.
    </para>

    <para>
      For Hong Kong, which uses Traditional Chinese and where Cantonese is the
dominant language, the Hong Kong Supplementary Character Set was added to
Unicode in 2005 and revised in 2009 (it is part of CJK Extension B and
contains more than 1900 characters). Earlier fonts will not be able to
support either Cantonese or use of these characters where local names are
written in Mandarin. The UMing HK, Noto Sans CJK HK and WenQuanYi Zen Hei
fonts all seem to cover Hong Kong usage
(<application>fontconfig</application> disagrees about Noto Sans CJK HK).
    </para>

    <para>
      The Han glyphs are double-width, other glyphs in the same font may be
narrower. For their CJK content, all of these fonts can be regarded as
monospaced (i.e. fixed width).
    </para>

    <para>
      If all you wish to do is to be able to render CJK glyphs, installing <xref

already have a preference.

      In Chinese, there are three font styles in common use: Sung (also known as
Song or Ming) which is the most-common ornamented ("serif")  form, Kai

you probably do not want to install Kai fonts.

      The <ulink url="https://moji.or.jp/ipafont/">IPAex fonts</ulink> are the
current version of the IPA fonts. Use <ulink

Translate</ulink> on the home page, then click on the download link for
IPAex Font Ver.004.01.  Unfortunately, <application>fontconfig</application>
only knows about the older IPAfonts and the forked IPA Mona font (which is
not easily available and which apparently does not meet Debian's Free
Software guidelines). Therefore if you install the IPAex fonts you may wish
to make it known to fontconfig, see <xref
linkend="prefer-chosen-CJK-fonts"/> for one possible way to do this.

      The <ulink url="https://osdn.net/projects/efont/releases/p1357">Kochi

    <para>
      In Korean, Batang or Myeongjo (the older name) are Serif, Dotum or Gothic
are the main Sans fonts. BLFS previously recommended the Baekmuk fonts, but
the Nanum and Un fonts are now preferred to Baekmuk by
<application>fontconfig</application> because of user requests.
    </para>

    

    <!-- when testing, my previous Nanum link gave permission errors, so
    link to a general page, at the cost of making it more complicated to
    download -->
<para>
      A convenient place to see examples of these and many other Korean fonts is
<ulink url="https://www.freekoreanfont.com/">Free Korean
Fonts</ulink>. Click on 'Gothic Fonts' or 'All Categories -> Myeongjo
Fonts', then click on the font example to see more details including the
License, and click on the link to download it. For Nanum, you will need to
be able to read Korean to find the download link on the page you get to. For
Un there are direct links and you can find the un-fonts-core tarball in the
<filename class="directory">releases/</filename> directory.
    </para>

      Alternatively, consider <xref linkend="NotoSansCJK"/> (all of the variants
cover Hangul) or <xref linkend="wenquanyi-zenhei"/>.
