  <title>Window Managers</title>

  <para>
    Window Managers and Desktop Environments are the primary user interfaces
into the <application>X</application> Window System. A window manager is a
program that controls the appearance of windows and provides the means by
which the user can interact with them. A Desktop Environment provides a more
complete interface to the operating system, and provides a range of
integrated utilities and applications.
  </para>

  <para>
    There are many Window Managers available. Some of the more well known ones
include <application>fvwm2</application>, <application>Window
Maker</application>, <application>AfterStep</application>,
<application>Enlightenment</application>,
<application>Sawfish</application>, and <application>Blackbox</application>.
  </para>

  <para>
    The Desktop Environments available for Linux are
<application>GNOME</application>, <application>KDE</application>, and
<application>XFce</application>.
  </para>

  <para>
    Choosing a Window Manager or Desktop Environment is highly subjective. The
choice depends on the look and feel of the packages, the resources (RAM,
disk space) required, and the utilities included.  One web site that
provides a very good summary of what is available, screenshots, and their
respective features is <ulink url="http://www.xwinman.org/"> Window Managers
for X </ulink>.
  </para>

  <para>
    In this chapter, the installation instructions of several Window Managers
and one lightweight Desktop Environment are presented. Later in the book,
both <application>KDE</application> and <application>GNOME</application>
have their own sections.
