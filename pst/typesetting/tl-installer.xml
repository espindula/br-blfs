    <title>Introdução a TeX Live and its installer</title>

    <para>
      The <application>TeX Live</application> package is a comprehensive TeX
document production system.  It includes TeX, LaTeX2e, ConTeXt, Metafont,
MetaPost, BibTeX and many other programs; an extensive collection of macros,
fonts and documentation; and support for typesetting in many different
scripts from around the world.
    </para>

    <para>
      This page is for people who wish to use the binary installer to provide the
programs, the scripts, and a lot of supporting files and documentation.  The
installer is updated frequently, so any published md5sum will soon be out of
date.  Newer versions of the installer are expected to work with these
instructions, for so long as they install to a <filename
class="directory">&texlive-year;/</filename> directory.
    </para>

    <para>
      There are two reasons why you may wish to install the binaries in BLFS:
either you need a smaller install (e.g. at a minimum plain TeX without
LaTeX2e, ConTeXt, etc), or you wish to use <command>tlmgr</command> to get
updates whilst this version is supported (typically, until April of the year
after it was released). For the latter, you might prefer to install in your
<filename class="directory">/home</filename> directory as an unprivileged
user, and to then make corresponding changes to the PATH in your
<filename>~/.bashrc</filename> or equivalent.

    <title>Binary Installation of TeX Live</title>

    <para>
      The <application>TeX Live</application> set of programs with its supporting
documents, fonts, and utilities is very large.  The upstream maintainers
recommend placing all files in a single directory structure.  BLFS
recommends <filename class='directory'>/opt/texlive</filename>.
    </para>

    <para>
      As with any other package, unpack the installer and change into its
directory, <filename class='directory'>
install-tl-&lt;CCYYMMDD&gt;</filename>.  This directory name changes when
the installer is updated, so replace &lt;CCYYMMDD&gt; by the correct
directory name.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        The distribution binaries installed below may use static linking for general
linux system libraries.  Additional libraries or interpreters as specified
in the dependencies section do not need to be present during the install,
but the programs that need them will not run until their specific
dependencies have been installed.
      </para>

    
      <!-- please keep something like this in the future -->
<para>
        With all contributed binary software, there may be a mismatch between the
builder's toolchain and your hardware.  In most of TeX this will probably
not matter, but in uncommon corner cases you might hit problems. For
example, if your x86_64 processor does not support 3dnowext or 3dnow, the
2014-06-28 binary failed in conTeXt when running LuaTeX, although lualatex
worked, as did the i686 binaries on the same machine. In such cases, the
easiest solution is to install texlive from source. Similarly, the x86_64
binary version of <command>asy</command> runs very slowly when creating 3-D
diagrams.

      This command is interactive and allows selection or modification of
platform, packages, directories, and other options. The full installation
scheme will require about 4.9 gigabytes of disk space. The time to complete
the download will depend on your internet connection speed and the number of
packages selected.

variation of this if you wish to use a different mirror, for example,
because you are in New Zealand but the installer chooses to use an
Australian mirror. The list of mirrors is at <ulink
